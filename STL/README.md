# Containers

STL (Standard Template Library) containers are predefined data structures provided by the C++ Standard Library. These containers are templates, meaning they can store elements of any data type, providing flexibility and reusability in code. STL containers offer a wide range of functionalities for storing, accessing, and manipulating data efficiently.

Here are some key features and types of STL containers:

#Sequence Containers:

**Vector:** Dynamic array that can resize itself.
**Deque:** Double-ended queue that supports insertion and deletion at both ends.
**List:** Doubly linked list where each element contains a link to the next and previous elements.
**Forward List:** Singly linked list where each element contains a link to the next element only.

#Associative Containers:

**Set:** Collection of unique, sorted elements where each element is unique.
**Multiset:** Collection of sorted elements where duplicates are allowed.
**Map:** Collection of key-value pairs where keys are unique and sorted.
**Multimap:** Collection of key-value pairs where keys can have duplicates.

#Unordered Containers:

**Unordered Set:** Collection of unique elements with no specific order.
**Unordered Multiset:** Collection of elements with no specific order, allowing duplicates.
**Unordered Map:** Collection of key-value pairs with no specific order, where keys are unique.
**Unordered Multimap:** Collection of key-value pairs with no specific order, allowing key duplicates.

#Container Adapters:

**Stack:** LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure, where elements are inserted and removed from the same end.
**Queue:** FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure, where elements are inserted at the back and removed from the front.
**Priority Queue:** Data structure where elements are removed based on priority, rather than the order of insertion.
