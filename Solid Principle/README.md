# Solid Principle 


ChatGPT
The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines designed to improve the design and maintainability of object-oriented software. These principles help developers create more understandable, flexible, and maintainable code. The SOLID acronym stands for:

+Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
+Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
+Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
+Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
+Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)


# 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

    Definition: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.

# 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

    Definition: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

# 3.Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

    Definition: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

# 4.Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

    Definition: A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use.

# 5.Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

    Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

Summary
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Ensure each class has only one responsibility.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be replaceable for their base types without affecting the program.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.

# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Keyword: One job
Description: A class should have only one reason to change. Each class should only have one responsibility.
Mnemonic: Think of a single-task worker, like a librarian who only organizes books.

# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Keyword: Extendable
Description: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
Mnemonic: Picture a plug-in system where you add new plug-ins without altering the main system.

# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Keyword: Replaceable
Description: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program.
Mnemonic: Imagine a car rental service where any car (subclass) can replace any other without issue.

# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Keyword: Specific
Description: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Interfaces should be small and specific.
Mnemonic: Think of a restaurant menu where you can order only what you want, rather than a fixed, all-inclusive meal.

# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Keyword: Abstraction
Description: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Mnemonic: Picture an electrical outlet (high-level) that can accept any device's plug (low-level) as long as it follows the outlet's interface.

Memory Trick Using a Story
You can create a short story using these keywords to make it even more memorable:

"A library has One job (SRP) and can Extend (OCP) by adding new sections without altering existing ones. Any Replaceable (LSP) book can be borrowed without issues. The library has Specific (ISP) sections for different genres, and all electrical devices plug into the same Abstraction (DIP) socket."

Quick Summary
S - Single Responsibility Principle (One job)
O - Open/Closed Principle (Extendable)
L - Liskov Substitution Principle (Replaceable)
I - Interface Segregation Principle (Specific)
D - Dependency Inversion Principle (Abstraction)
