# Diamond Problem
    Definition:
    The diamond problem occurs in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a single common base class, resulting in ambiguity about which path to follow to the base class.

    Illustration:
    Consider four classes: A, B, C, and D where:

    B and C inherit from A.
    D inherits from both B and C.

        A
    / \
    B   C
    \ /
        D

    class A {
    public:
        void show() {
            std::cout << "Class A" << std::endl;
        }
    };

    class B : public A {
    };

    class C : public A {
    };

    class D : public B, public C {
    };

    int main() {
        D obj;
        // obj.show(); // This will cause ambiguity
        return 0;
    }

    In the above example, if you try to call obj.show(), the compiler will throw an ambiguity error because it doesn't know whether to call A's show method through B or through C.

    ##How C++ Handles the Diamond Problem
    Virtual Inheritance:
    C++ resolves the diamond problem using virtual inheritance. By declaring the inheritance from the base class as virtual, C++ ensures that only one instance of the base class is created.

    Code with Virtual Inheritance:
    Modify the inheritance to be virtual:

    class A {
    public:
        void show() {
            std::cout << "Class A" << std::endl;
        }
    };

    class B : virtual public A {
    };

    class C : virtual public A {
    };

    class D : public B, public C {
    };

    int main() {
        D obj;
        obj.show(); // This works fine now
        return 0;
    }

    In this revised example, B and C virtually inherit from A, so when D inherits from B and C, it gets only one copy of A.

    ##Internal Working:

    When B and C virtually inherit from A, the compiler ensures that A is initialized only once, regardless of how many times it is virtually inherited.
    This is achieved by creating a virtual table (vtable) that keeps track of the virtual base classes.
    When D is instantiated, it has only one instance of A, shared by both B and C.

    ##Benefits of Virtual Inheritance
    Avoids Ambiguity: Ensures that there is only one instance of the base class, avoiding the ambiguity problem.
    Memory Efficiency: Saves memory by avoiding multiple copies of the base class.
    Consistency: Provides a consistent and clear path of inheritance.
